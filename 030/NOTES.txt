030 - IF-ELSE VS SWITCH


DEFINITION

Depending on the condition in the 'if' statement, 'if' and 'else' blocks are executed.

The user will decide which statement is to be executed.





EXPRESSION

It contains either logical or equality expression.

It contains a single expression which can be either a character or integer variable.





EVALUATION

It evaluates all types of data, such as integer, floating-point, character or Boolean.

It evaluates either an integer, or character.




SEQUENCE OF EXECUTION

First, the condition is checked. If the condition is true then 'if' block is executed otherwise 'else' block.

It executes one case after another till the break keyword is not found, or the default statement is executed.





DEFAULT EXECUTION

If the condition is not true, then by default, else block will be executed.

If the value does not match with any case, then by default, default statement is executed.





EDITING

Editing is not easy in the 'if-else' statement.

Cases in a switch statement are easy to maintain and modify. The removal or editing of any case will not interrupt the execution of other cases.





SPEED 

If there are multiple choices implemented through 'if-else', then the speed of the execution will be slow.

If we have multiple choices then the switch statement is the best option as the speed of the execution will be much higher than 'if-else'.

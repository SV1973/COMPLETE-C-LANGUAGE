017 - CONSTANTS IN C 


A constant is a value or variable that can't be changed in the program, for example: 10, 20, 'a', 3.4, "c programming" etc.




There are two ways to define constant in C programming.

1. The const keyword is used to define constant in C programming.

const float PI=3.14; 

2. The #define preprocessor is also used to define constant.

#define PI 3.14

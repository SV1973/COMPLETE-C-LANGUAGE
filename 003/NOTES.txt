003 - FEATURES OF C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.


1)  SIMPLE

C is a simple language in the sense that it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), the rich set of library functions, data types, etc.


2)  Machine Independent or Portable

C programs can be executed on different machines with some machine specific changes.


3)  Mid-Level Programming Language

C is intended to do low-level programming. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver, etc. It also supports the features of a high-level language. That is why it is known as mid-level language.


4)  Structured Programming Language

C is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions.


5)  Rich Library

C provides a lot of inbuilt functions that make the development fast.


6)  Memory Management

It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation.
In C language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.


7)  Speed

The compilation and execution time of C language is fast since there are lesser inbuilt functions and hence the lesser overhead.


8)  Pointer

C provides the feature of pointers.
We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers.
We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array, etc.


9) Recursion

In C, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function.
Recursion enables us to use the approach of backtracking.


10) Extensible

C language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features.

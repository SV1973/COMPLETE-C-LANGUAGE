Difference between conditional operator and if-else statement :-

A conditional operator is a single programming statement, while the 'if-else' statement is a programming block in which statements come under the parenthesis.

A conditional operator can also be used for assigning a value to the variable, whereas the 'if-else' statement cannot be used for the assignment purpose.

It is not useful for executing the statements when the statements are multiple, whereas the 'if-else' statement proves more suitable when executing multiple statements.

The nested ternary operator is more complex and cannot be easily debugged, while the nested 'if-else' statement is easy to read and maintain.

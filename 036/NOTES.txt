036 - INFINITE LOOPS IN C


WHAT IS AN INFINITE LOOP?

An infinite loop is a looping construct that does not terminate the loop and executes the loop forever.

It either produces a continuous output or no output.






WHEN TO USE AN INFINITE LOOP?


An infinite loop is useful for those applications that accept the user input and generate the output continuously until the user exits from the application manually.

In the following situations, this type of loop can be used:

All the operating systems run in an infinite loop as it does not exist after performing some task.

All the servers run in an infinite loop as the server responds to all the client requests.

All the games also run in an infinite loop. The game will accept the user requests until the user exits from the game.





We can create an infinite loop through various loop structures. The following are the loop structures through which we will define the infinite loop:

for loop
while loop
do-while loop
go to statement
C macros

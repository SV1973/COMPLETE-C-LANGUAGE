039 - C GOTO STATEMENT


The goto statement is known as jump statement in C.

goto is used to transfer the program control to a predefined label.

The goto statment can be used to repeat some part of the code for a particular condition.

It can also be used to break the multiple loops which can't be done by using a single break statement.




WHEN SHOULD WE USE GOTO 

The only condition in which using goto is preferable is when we need to break the multiple loops using a single statement at the same time.

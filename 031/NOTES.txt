031 - C LOOPS

The looping can be defined as repeating the same process multiple times until a specific condition satisfies.






WHY USE LOOPS IN C LANGUAGE

The looping simplifies the complex problems into the easy ones.

It enables us to alter the flow of the program so that instead of writing the same code again and again, we can repeat the same code for a finite number of times.






ADVANTAGES OF LOOPS

1) It provides code reusability.

2) Using loops, we do not need to write the same code again and again.

3) Using loops, we can traverse over the elements of data structures (array or linked lists).






TYPES OF C LOOPS

There are three types of loops in C language
that is given below:

do while
while
for

COMPILE-TIME VS RUN-TIME





Compile-time is the time at which the source code is converted into an executable code.

Run time is the time at which the executable code is started running.


The compile-time errors are the errors which are produced at the compile-time, and they are detected by the compiler.

The runtime errors are the errors which are not generated by the compiler and produce an unpredictable result at the execution time.


In this case, the compiler prevents the code from execution if it detects an error in the program.

In this case, the compiler does not detect the error, so it cannot prevent the code from the execution.


It contains the syntax and semantic errors such as missing semicolon at the end of the statement.

It contains the errors such as division by zero, determining the square root of a negative number.

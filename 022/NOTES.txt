PROGRAMMING ERROS IN C


Errors are the problems or the faults that occur in the program, which makes the behavior of the program abnormal, and experienced developers can also make these faults.

Programming errors are also known as the bugs or faults, and the process of removing these bugs is known as debugging.






There are mainly five types of errors exist in C programming:




Syntax Error :- 

Syntax errors are also known as the compilation errors as they occurred at the compilation time, or we can say that the syntax errors are thrown by the compilers.

These errors are mainly occurred due to the mistakes while typing or do not follow the syntax of the specified programming language.




Run-time Error :- 

Sometimes the errors exist during the execution-time even after the successful compilation known as run-time errors.

When the program is running, and it is not able to perform the operation is the main cause of the run-time error.

These errors are very difficult to find, as the compiler does not point to these errors.





Linker Error :- 

Linker errors are mainly generated when the executable file of the program is not created. 

This can be happened either due to the wrong function prototyping or usage of the wrong header file.






Logical Error :- 

The logical error is an error that leads to an undesired output. These errors produce the incorrect output, but they are error-free, known as logical errors.
The occurrence of these errors mainly depends upon the logical thinking of the developer.






Semantic Error :- 

Semantic errors are the errors that occurred when the statements are not understandable by the compiler.
